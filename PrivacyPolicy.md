# Privacy Policy
- NubSoft does not collect data on you
- NubSoft doesn't uses ads and probably wont
- Data doesn't get sold, since we don't collect it
- The only place files are stored or any type of "data" is, is at /storage/emulated/0/notesapp and /storage/emulated/.notesapp
- NubSoft will never ask for personal info or your data
- This Privacy Policy counts for Aptoide and all Catappult app stores. Any other app store I'm not on, I'm not accountable for is not worthy of this.
# Notes App
- Notes app is simple and doesn't need any addition.
- By Notes app I mean My Notes Manager.
# Java editor PRO
- Licenses are always obfuscated with a salted hash, locked behind an api.
- Java Editor PRO logs the ip addresses of anyone who uses a license to prevent License Sharing.
- We do have to communicate via discord for the Java PRO license.
- We don't use Aptoide for IAP, but not IAP an external communication process.
